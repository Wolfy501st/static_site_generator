## Reasons I love Sailor Moon

- Glitter, friendship, cosmic justice â€” what more do you need?
- Itâ€™s a perfect mix of high drama and adorable goofiness
- Each Scout is unique and lovable in their own way
- The fashion? ICONIC.
- It's a magical girl gateway drug (and proud of it)

## My favorite characters (in order)

1. Sailor Moon (of course ðŸ’–)
2. Sailor Jupiter (powerhouse with a heart of gold)
3. Sailor Saturn (mysterious and intense)
4. Luna (cat mentor goals)
5. Sailor Mercury (the brains and the beauty)
6. Sailor Mars (fiery in every sense)
7. Sailor Venus (idol energy)
8. Tuxedo Mask (he tries his best, okay?)
9. Queen Beryl (we love a dramatic villainess)

Hereâ€™s what `mooncode` looks like (it only runs on pure starlight):

```
sparkle.transform({
    heart: "pure",
    tiara: "ready",
    mood: "determined"
})
```
